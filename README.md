An IEEE article: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9080729
Abstract—An automated condition monitoring system is designed to diagnose different type of faults and their severity in an induction motor. The parameters include current, vibration, rotor speed and temperature are used to determine different electrical and mechanical faults. Most of the faults such as stator short windings, broken rotor bars and air gap eccentricity are determined by the frequency domain analysis of current and the technique used for this purpose is Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA). These different faults can be diagnosed using this technique because each type of fault produces a spike in the frequency spectrum at a specific frequency. Winding temperature is also measured to complement the diagnosis based on this technique. Vibration analysis is used to detect mechanical faults; most important of which are the bearing faults and the parameter of rotor speed is required for this purpose. The system designed is capable of working under different load conditions. The system uses MATLAB software, Arduino Microcontroller and inexpensive sensors that’s why its a cost effective solution.
